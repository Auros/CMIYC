  TextContents: 'You''re at the tail end of the time with some of the most important
    people in your life. One day, you will see them for the last time.



    And
    it''s actually the same with everything else.



    The concept of doing something
    for the last time feels eerie, like something that you should only experience
    when you''re on death row, or extremely old, or something like that.



    But
    it happens all the time.'
